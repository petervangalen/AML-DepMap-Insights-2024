# AML-DepMap-Insights-2024
Analysis of DepMap 2024 data for various questions in the Van Galen Lab.

### AnalysisPeter/1_Projection
Project cell lines onto a UMAP of healthy bone marrow cells to get a sense of their differentiation state. This was never published.

### AnalysisPeter/2_Expression
Plot expression of _EIF4A1_, _EIF4A2_, and _EIF4A3_ across AML cell lines. This is included in Lee _et al._, [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.20.629809v1), 2024.

### AnalysisPeter/3_CRISPR-dependency
Histogram shows gene dependency (x) and number of cell lines (y). All genes are shown in gray to illustrate overall range of DepMap dependency values. Vertical lines indicate AML cell line dependency on _EIF4A1_ (red), _EIF4A2_ (green), and _EIF4A3_ (blue). These data indicate high _EIF4A3_ dependence, intermediate _EIF4A1_ dependence, and low _EIF4A2_ dependence across AML cell lines. This is part of an ongoing project.

### AnalysisPeter/4_DrugAnalysis
Evaluate the sensitivity to Zotatifin (x) vs. _EIF4A1_ expression (y) based on public DepMap data. This is included in Lee _et al._, [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.20.629809v1), 2024.
